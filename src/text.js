        "I created this app for the company Simply English in Moscow Russia.  The userbase consists of English-speaking teachers adjusting to life in Moscow. As part of their duties, teachers need to travel to multiple schools around Moscow - a city which occupies a massive amount of real estate. The app consolidates several functions into one place.  Teachers are able to access contacts for emergencies, receive their schedule, and order office supplies. The app also allows teachers to easily route to their apartment and clients, with Yandex - the Russian equivilent of Google. Teachers may also check school calendars, and the app also includes an interactive guidebook to help adjust to life in Russia.  The app is reguarly used by around 50 users at any given time.",

        'Happily, based upon the success of the first application, I am expected to develop a second iteraction at the conclusion of the 2020 school year.'

        'This is the first app I created.  It is a simple flashcard app, designed to help learners memorize the Japanese hiragana.  I hand drew each character in Sketch, composed the sound effects with GarageBand and commissioned a native speaker to record audio for each character.  It was important for me to be able to integrate sound into this application, as well as audio and visual cues that made the experience gratifying and pleasant.',
