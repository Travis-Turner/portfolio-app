Teachers are able to access contacts for emergencies, receive their schedule, and order office supplies. The app also allows teachers to easily route to their apartment and clients, with Yandex - the Russian equivilent of Google. Teachers may also check school calendars, and the app also includes an interactive guidebook to help adjust to life in Russia.
